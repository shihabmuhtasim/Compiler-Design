# Compiler Design Lab Repository

Welcome to the **Compiler Design Lab Repository**, where you can find comprehensive materials on key stages in compiler design. This repository contains structured and modular labs, each focusing on an essential component of the compiler: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and symbol table management.

## Overview

This repository offers a clear walkthrough of compiler design principles, breaking down each critical phase into separate labs. These materials aim to guide you in constructing a working compiler through incremental steps and exercises, enhancing your understanding of language processing and compilation.

## Lab Contents

### Lab 1: Lexical Analyzer
The **Lexical Analyzer** (or Lexer) is the first step in the compiler design process. This lab provides tools to tokenize input code, converting sequences of characters into meaningful tokens. It covers:
- Token definitions
- Regular expressions for lexical patterns
- Identification of keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals
  
### Lab 2: Syntax Analyzer
The **Syntax Analyzer** (or Parser) is responsible for validating the structure of token sequences based on the grammar of the language. This lab includes:
- Grammar definitions
- Parse tree generation
- Error handling in syntax analysis

### Lab 3: Symbol Table
The **Symbol Table** lab focuses on managing identifiers and their scope, providing storage and retrieval mechanisms for symbols (variables, functions, etc.) within a program. Key features:
- Symbol insertion, lookup, and deletion
- Scope management
- Type checking and symbol information storage
